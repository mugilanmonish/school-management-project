                                                                                    Project Overview:

Technologies:
              Frontend Development: React.js
              Backend Development: Node.js
              Database: MongoDB
Deployment:
            Frontend: Hosted on Vercel
            Backend: Hosted on Render

Getting Started:

Step 1: Accessing Pages

Admin Page:
            Click the "Admin" button.
Credentials:
            Name: vimalraj
            Password: 9791
Teachers Page:
              Click the "Teachers" button.
Credentials:
            Mail: prajwal@gmail.com
            Password: prajwal123!@#
Students Page:
              Click the "Students" button.
Credentials:
              Mail: balaji@gmail.com
              Password: balaji123!@#
Note: The forms on each page change when you press the respective buttons.

Step 2: Navigating the Admin Page

                                   Once you enter the admin page, you will see two profile cards. Hover over them and press the arrow to explore the lists of teachers or students.
                                   You can add new teachers using the "Add Teachers" button, which will lead you to the registration page.
                                   On the registration form, form validation is provided, and text field colors will change to indicate errors.
                                   Once a new profile card is created, you can edit details or delete the card. This functions as a CRUD operation.
                                   Once you update the data or delete a profile card, if the expected result does not appear immediately, simply refresh the page. This may occur due to the server being hosted on Render.

Step 3: Navigating Teachers and Students Pages

                                Return to the login page and choose either the teachers or students page.
                                Log in using the appropriate mail ID and password.
                                If you enter incorrect credentials, an alert message will appear.
                                After logging in, you can view the profile card of the respective teacher or student.

Future Development:

                  The admin will be able to assign tasks to teachers and students individually.
                  Teachers and students will be able to submit their work to the admin through the website.
